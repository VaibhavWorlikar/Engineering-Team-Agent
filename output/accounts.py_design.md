## Overview

The `accounts.py` module contains a single class `Account` for managing a trading simulation platform's account functionalities, such as creating an account, depositing and withdrawing funds, buying and selling shares, and calculating portfolio values and profit/loss. It also provides mechanisms for viewing account transactions and enforcing trading constraints.

## Class and Function Design

### Class: Account

#### Methods:

- `__init__(self, username: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`: 
  - Initializes an account with a username and an initial deposit. Sets up data structures for holding shares and tracking transactions.
  
- `deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`:
  - Allows the user to deposit additional funds into their account.
  
- `withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`:
  - Attempts to withdraw funds from the account. Ensures the user's balance remains non-negative. Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.
  
- `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`:
  - Records a transaction where the user buys a specified quantity of shares of a stock symbol. Checks if the user has enough funds to complete the transaction, and returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.
  
- `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`:
  - Records a transaction where the user sells a specified quantity of shares of a stock symbol. Ensures the user has enough shares to sell, and returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.
  
- `calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float`:
  - Computes the total current market value of all shares in the user's portfolio using the `get_share_price(symbol)` function for current market prices.
  
- `calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float`:
  - Computes and returns the profit or loss by comparing the current portfolio value plus account cash to the initial deposit amount.
  
- `report_holdings(self) -> str`:
  - Returns a string detailing the quantities of shares currently held by the user, and their market values.
  
- `report_profit_loss(self) -> str`:
  - Returns a string stating the current profit or loss of the user.
  
- `list_transactions(self) -> list`:
  - Returns a list of all transactions, detailing action types (deposit, withdraw, buy, sell), timestamps, share symbols, quantities, and transaction amounts.

#### Helper Methods:

- `get_balance(self) -> float`:
  - Returns the current cash balance of the account.
  
- `get_total_share_value(self) -> float`:
  - Computes the total value of all shares currently in the user's portfolio.
  
- `record_transaction(self, action: str, symbol: str, quantity: int, transaction_value: float) -> None`:
  - Adds an entry to the transactions log for a given buying or selling action.
  
- `get_share_quantity(self, symbol: str) -> int`:
  - Returns the number of shares held for a specific stock symbol.

### External Dependency

- `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`:
  - An external function assumed to return the current market price of the given stock symbol. This method is crucial for both purchasing shares and calculating portfolio values.

This structured design provides a robust starting point for the backend development of a trading simulation account management system, ensuring a comprehensive handling of all described functionalities and constraints.
